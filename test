Issue #1 (Individual Issue) - Michael Drolet
    No picture shown when choosing a race
	
	How to test?
	Run game.py and navigate to Create Character. Select a gender, and this will bring the user to
	the desired page to test. Each race has a default avatar that is shown below their respective 
	descriptions. Clicking down on the keypad allows the user to see each avatar in its default 
	state. This gives the user an idea of what each race looks like.

Issue #4 (Individual issue) - Rhys P.
     Make end of fight stat changes more readable
	
	Run game.py and start a new campaign or load a saved game. Navigate through the world until an 
	enemy is encountered and combat is initiated. Combat must be successfully won. Messages reading 
	“The party tends to their wounds”, "Negative status effects removed, all fainted party members 
	recovered", and "Each party member is healed of their most recent wound" will be displayed. If 
	all party members are killed and combat is lost, the messages will not appear.

    Resolution support - updated so user can choose resolution size from a list

	of possible sizes. Typing a number from this list brings up the corresponding resolution size.
	Typing a number outside of this list will alert the user with INVALID OPTION, and prompt the user
	to re-enter a number from the list.
