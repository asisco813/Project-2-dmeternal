Issue #1 (Individual Issue) - Michael Drolet
    No picture shown when choosing a race

    How to test?
    Run game.py and navigate to Create Character. Select a gender, and this will bring the user to
    the desired page to test.
    Each race has a default avatar that is shown below their respective descriptions. Clicking down on
    the keypad allows the user to see each avatar in its default state. This gives the user an idea of
    what each race looks like.

Issue #5 (Individual Issue) - Amari Sisco
    Resolution support - updated so user can choose resolution size from a list

    How to test?
    Run game.py
    In the terminal, there should be a prompt asking user to select a resolution size from a list
    of possible sizes. Typing a number from this list brings up the corresponding resolution size.
    Typing a number outside of this list will alert the user with INVALID OPTION, and prompt the user
    to re-enter a number from the list.

Issue #25 (Group Issue) - Amari Sisco and Michael Drolet
	Add option to move using keys

	How to test?
	Run game.py and navigate to an existing campaign. This should show the last save state of the characters
	To move normally, the user would click on a location in the grid and the characters would move onto said
	location. To move with KEYS, use the keypad located on the lower-right of a standard keyboard. Each
	button press will direct the user in the direction based on the keys.
